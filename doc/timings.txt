Floppy timings:
---------------
Citizen Z1DE-58A (a generic HD PC drive):
 Read pulse width: low for ~400ns
 INDEX pulse width: low for 2ms
 STEP: latched on trailing (rising) edge
  - RDDAT immediately deasserted
  - TRK0 immediately deasserted
  - TRK0 asserted after 3ms
  - RDDAT asserted after 18ms
 DSKCHG: deasserted immediately on falling edge of STEP,
         even if STEP is to be ignored (eg. on min/max cyl already)
 Side change: within 20us, read stream not halted meanwhile.

Cortex-M3 STM32F1xx Timings:
----------------------------
Times assume 72MHz clock (14ns cycle time)
ldr Rt,[Rn,#x] = 1cy,14ns memory; 3cy,42ns gpio
irq entry = 12cy,167ns
irq exit = 10cy,139ns

HxC Gotek Timings:
------------------
1. RDY is always asserted, regardless of whether a disk is inserted,
USB inserted, disk being swapped, etc etc
2. RDY is ungated in ~0.45us
3. All signals gated in ~0.75us
4. Other signals (TRK0 tested) ungated in ~0.95us
Timing precision is ~0.05us
